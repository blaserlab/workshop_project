Congrats for finding this project.

For those of you who are forking this project to your own github, that is a great way to stay up to date as we develop the scripts over the next several weeks.

One thing:  we are intentionally ignoring git_commands.R in the git repo.  This is because we often make edits to it after committing and by ignoring the file we keep our repository in a "clean" state.

You should run the command ```blaseRtemplates::regenerate_git_commands()``` to get this file back in your R directory.
